      <h2 className= "aboutTitle">About Amy</h2>
      <p className= "aboutDetails">I'm a graduate of James Madison University with a B.S. in Dietetics who had the wild and crazy idea to explore a lifelong passion of web development. Outside of my work-life, I'm a married mom of 2 gorgeous daughters. When I'm not typing ferociously at my computer, or keeping a close eye on the current dangers of social media for young girls, I can be found running, exercising, or finding fun ways to determine the best pizza joint in town. I played sports growing up, with soccer being my favorite, so I'm a big fan and supporter of the US men's and women's national soccer teams. Outside of soccer, I enjoy watching college and NFL football, as well as hockey. Playing sports taught me the importance of team work. I was never the team's leading scorer, but I always lead in assists.</p>
